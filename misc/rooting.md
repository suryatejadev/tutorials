### Rooting a Nexus (like) device
1. Install ADB toolkit on PC.
2. Follow ADB commands from any website.
3. First unlock bootloader. Then install TWRP recovery.
4. Take backup and store the file on PC.
5. In order to install another rom, the present OS must be wiped.
6. Go to advance wipe and select all ( caches, system, data etc. ).
7. Go to install and select the zip file of the appropriate ROM.
8. Also, install gapps.zip ( google apps ) and flash it after flashing the ROM.
9. Then, if required, flash SuperSu. Unlocking the bootloader gives root privileges. To manage them, SuperSu must be installed.
10. Further, if any other ROM is to be installed, first take backup, then advance wipe everything and then flash the new ROM,gapps.zip and supersu if it is not already available in the ROM.
11. For flashing kernels, no wiping is required. Just go to recovery and flash the zip file of the kernel.
